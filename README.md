# SpaceX-Data-Analysis
SpaceX dramatically reduced launch costs by reusing Falcon 9 first-stage boosters. Successful booster landings are critical to this cost efficiency.
This project analyzes historical SpaceX launch data to:
  1). Identify factors that influence first-stage landing success
  2). Explore how launch site, payload mass, orbit type, and flight number affect outcomes
  3). Build machine learning models to predict landing success
The ultimate goal: determine whether historical launch data can reliably predict booster landing outcomes
